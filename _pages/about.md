I am currently a senior student at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), enrolled in the 3+2 engineering program under the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am completing my senior year studies, research, and preparations at UCI, while planning to pursue a Ph.D. in the future. Prior to this, I completed the first three years of my undergraduate study (2021.09-2024.06) at the School of Computer Science, [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/). During this time, I was awarded the third-class scholarship in 2023 and the second-class scholarship in 2024. I have completed both core and elective courses in computer science with strong academic performance and have actively participated in extracurricular competitions and internships, enhancing my coding skills and problem-solving abilities. I consider my ability and passion for learning new things to be my greatest strengths.
