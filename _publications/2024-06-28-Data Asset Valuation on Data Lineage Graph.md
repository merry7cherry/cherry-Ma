**Abstract**

Core data assets are high-value data tables critical for enterprise business activities. Data asset valuation is the process of evaluating the economic value of data assets within an enterprise. This can be used to identify core data assets. However, efficient, accurate, and generalizable core data asset valuation methods are lacking. Data lineage graphs (DLGs) effectively assist in facilitating core data asset identification. In this work, we propose a method named graph-based data asset valuation (GBDAV). A set of important criteria are designed to guide the valuation of data assets in DLGs. A formula is established to quantify the value of data assets in DLGs. A heat diffusion model simulates data transformations in DLGs, defining the dynamic value for each table based on heat input and output. Two heat transfer matrices and iteratively update dynamic value until thermal equilibrium is reached. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed GBDAV.
