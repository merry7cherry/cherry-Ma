**Abstract**

Appearance defects significantly impact cigarette quality. However, in the current high-speed production lines, manual inspection and traditional methods are unable to satisfy the actual demands of inspection. Therefore, a real-time and high-precision defect detection model for cigarette appearance, SCS-YOLO, is presented. The model integrates space-to-depth convolution (SPD-Conv), a convolutional block attention module (CBAM), and a self-calibrated convolutional module (SCConv). SPD-Conv replaces the pooling structure to enhance the granularity of feature information. CBAM improves the ability to pay attention to defect locations. Improved self-calibrated convolution broadens the network’s receptive field and feature fusion capability. Additionally, Complete IoU loss (CIoU) is replaced with Efficient IoU Loss (EIoU) to enhance model localization and mitigate sample imbalance. The experimental results show that the accuracy of SCS-YOLO is 95.5% and the mAP (mean average precision) value is 95.2%. Compared with the original model, the accuracy and mAP value of the SCS-YOLO model are improved by 4.0%. Furthermore, the model achieves a detection speed of 216 FPS, meeting cigarette production lines’ accuracy and speed demands. Our research will positively impact the real-time detection of appearance defects in cigarette production lines.
